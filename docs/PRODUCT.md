# üì¶ PRODUCT

These are my selected, opinionated and very condensed thoughts on developing, growing and managing Product. If you would like to discuss these topics in more detail, I'm eager to engage.

### ‚ö° Products are useful

When developing a product, _usefulness_ is the primary ‚Äî if not only ‚Äî concern to focus on. If it isn't _useful_, it is not a product. You may be able to sell a useless thing to others, but I call that a _scam_ rather than a product.

A useful way of quantifying usefulness, is the popular _product/market fit_ ‚Äî or in other words, ‚ÄúHow _essential_ is this product for your customer?‚Äù. If they _can't_ live without your product, you have found perfect product/market fit, and many desirable paths open up for you.

Make sure you have a _robust_ and _iterative_ approach to determining product/market fit throughout all stages of the product lifetime. _Robust_ ‚Äî as in ensuring that testing always happens, and can't be tainted or subdued by other less-critical concerns, such as _brand value_, _budget_ or _scheduling_. _Iterative_ ‚Äî as it being a constant cycle of __assume__ ‚û° __build__ ‚û° __test__ ‚û° __adjust__. You _assume_ something will improve product/market fit, based on former iterations and current knowledge. You _build_ based on those assumptions, and quickly _test_ the validity of the assumptions. Finally, you can _adjust_ based on your tests, and make new assumptions for the next iteration. Useful iterations create useful products.

### üéâ Useful products are popular

Products can become popular for several reasons ‚Äî some more ephemeral than others. A mention by an entity with a large following, can lead to a great rise in popularity ‚Äî or awareness at least, but that doesn't always result in recurring revenue or even usage. If it isn't useful, it will not hold the attention of an audience without a constant (and likely massive) spend on marketing efforts. This leads us into a widespread dichotomy in marketing: _paid_ versus _organic_. _Paid_ marketing is traditional ad-spend on commercial messaging such as Google search ads, Billboards and TV-commercials, while _organic_ marketing can be defined as a _grass roots_ or _user-initiated_ word-of-mouth campaign. People telling other people positive things about your product, _without being paid to do so!_

A common misconception is that organic marketing is 'free' - understandable as it is always presented opposite to _paid_ marketing - but also untrue in almost all successful cases. The primary cost behind supporting a successful organic campaign is of course _creating a useful product_ - if something is useful to someone, they mostly can't stop telling other people about it. The second significant cost group is everything that comprises the _framework_ supporting the organic spread of your product's virtues. This includes simple things, like making your content easy to share, to more complex matters, such as regularly creating stories and other good opportunities for your fans to spread the good word. Making sure that the quality of your content is pristine - don't ever let your fans down by embarrassing them in front of their audience - and striking the right balance between push and pull also requires a constant investment of time, focus and effort.

### üíÄ Good products go bad

You've made a useful product, you've helped make it popular, and now you get to the tricky stuff: managing a successful product _without ruining it_.

Your product/market fit might be off the charts, MRR growing triple-digit percentages YoY, healthy bank account _and_ the team is growing with lots of super-smart new hires. Good stuff all-round. But this isn't the time to kick back and relax ‚Äî on the contrary. Soccer Olympian and World Champion Mia Hamm is credited with saying ‚ÄúIt is more difficult to stay on top than to get there‚Äù, and that certainly also holds true when it comes to managing a successful product.

Do not succumb to _well-intentioned terrible ideas_ - a pervasive issue in most organizations over a certain size. _Well intentioned terrible ideas_ are often birthed by very smart people, which can make the idea seem superficially well-reasoned, while in reality they might pose _existential risk_ to your product. I won't write an exhaustive list in this paragraph, but some typically _treacherous_ examples follow here: ‚ÄúCompetitor X has added functionality Y ‚Äî we should also add Y!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe can save X amount of money if we do Y instead of Z‚Äù and ‚ÄúA user suggested we implement X, because they believe that would very useful to them‚Äù. If these examples seem _sensible_ to you, do not fret ‚Äî that is why they are called _treacherous_. The dangers lie in _our reactions_ to these statements, not the statements themselves. It's _how_ we use them. If those examples are used as _reasons to make changes_, you will be heading towards certain disaster. Diverging from the path that drove your success: a laser-like focus on making the product _essential_ for your users. Nothing else should matter. On the other hand ‚Äî all of these examples are excellent _triggers_ to start _investigations_. Find out whether they hold opportunities to improve product/market fit. Most won't, _but some will_.

Managing Product at this stage is thus primarily _managing_ and _investigating_ both _risks_ and _opportunities_. Managing risks such as adding the _wrong_ features to an already successful product, which can be _catastrophic_ ‚Äî completely alienating your most ardent supporters. Conversely, being a bit late with a useful feature might just incur a small increase in opportunity cost. Investigating opportunities such as competitor feature sets or user suggestions, to determine if they actually make the product _more essential_ for your users, and if not ‚Äî throw it in the pile of _well-intentioned terrible ideas_. When managing an already successful product you will spend more effort on determining _what you shouldn't do_, rather than what to do. This means saying _no_ to many people with very well-intentioned ideas. This is a non-trivial exercise to get right in _any_ organization, and isn't as _easy_ as just saying _yes_ all the time. Most organizations will fail at this stage, unless they make a focused effort to _codify how to give and receive a 'no'_.

### ‚åö TL;DR

Develop useful products.

Make it easy to spread the love.

Be very selective on how the product evolves.
